# OSH OAKRIDGE BUILDNODE

This repository combines all the OSH modules and dependencies to deploy the OSH server and client for ORNL.

## Requirements
- [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- [Oakridge Build Node Repository](https://github.com/Botts-Innovative-Research/osh-oakridge-buildnode) 
- Node v22
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Required to run the PostGIS database system)

## Installation
Clone the repository and update all submodules recursively

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Botts-Innovative-Research/osh-oakridge-buildnode.git --recursive
```
If you've already cloned without `--recursive`, run:
```bash
cd path/to/osh-oakridge-buildnode
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
## Build 
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/osh-oakridge-buildnode
```

Run the build script (macOS/Linux):

```bash
./build-all.sh
```

Run the build script (Windows):

```bash
./build-all.bat
```

After the build completes, it can be located in `build/distributions/` 

## Deploy and Start OSH Node
1. Unzip the distribution using the command line or File Explorer:

    Option 1: Command Line
    ```bash
    # Note: Replace <version> with the current version, e.g. 3.0.0
    unzip build/distributions/osh-node-oscar-<version>.zip
    cd osh-node-oscar-<version>/osh-node-oscar-<version>
    ```
   ```bash
    # Note: Replace <version> with the current version, e.g. 3.0.0
    tar -xf build/distributions/osh-node-oscar-<version>.zip
    cd osh-node-oscar-<version>/osh-node-oscar-<version>
    ```
   Option 2: Use File Explorer
    1. Navigate to `path/to/osh-oakridge-buildnode/build/distributions/`
    2. Right-click `osh-node-oscar-<version>.zip` (where `<version>` is the current release version, e.g. `3.0.0`).
    3. Select **Extract All..**
    4. Choose your destination, (or leave the default) and extract.
1. Launch the OSH node and PostGIS Database:
   The database management system is handled through Docker. The default launch scripts automatically build and run a PostGIS container using the `Dockerfile` located in `dist/release/postgis`, and then start the OSH node.
   Run the launch script, `launch-all.sh` (or `launch.sh` within the `osh-node-oscar` folder directly if the database is already running) for linux/mac and `launch-all.bat` (or `launch.bat`) for windows.
2. Access the OSH Node
- Remote: **[ip-address]:8282/sensorhub/admin**
- Locally:  **http://localhost:8282/sensorhub/admin**

The default credentials to access the OSH Node are admin:admin. This can be changed in the Security section of the admin page.

**Language Selection**
The user can select different languages for the Admin UI by using the language drop-down menu located in the top right corner of the Admin UI toolbar. Selecting a new language will instantly switch the UI localization.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
2FA can be configured for users to add an extra layer of security. To set this up:
1. Log in to the Admin UI.
2. Navigate to the **Security** section.
3. Edit the user profile and set up Two-Factor Authentication. A popup window will appear with a QR code.
4. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) to complete the setup.

**Importing/Exporting Lane Configurations via CSV**
Configurations for Lane Systems can be bulk managed via spreadsheet (CSV).
1. Log in to the Admin UI.
2. Navigate to **Services -> OSCAR Service**.
3. Within the configuration form for the OSCAR service, locate the property for spreadsheet configuration (`spreadsheetConfigPath`).
4. To export, click the download button to retrieve the current configurations as a CSV file.
5. To import, upload your modified CSV file through the provided upload mechanism in the service configuration to apply new or updated lane setups.

For documentation on configuring a Lane System on the OSH Admin panel, please refer to the OSCAR Documentation provided in the Google Drive documentation folder.

## Deploy the Client
After configuring the Lanes on the OSH Admin Panel, you can navigate to the Clients endpoint:
- Remote: **[ip-address]:8282**
- Local: **http://localhost:8282/**

For documentation on configuring a server on the OSCAR Client refer to the OSCAR Documentation provided in the Google Drive documentation folder.
