# Rapiscan RPM Driver

Sensor adapter for Rapiscan Driver


## Overview


## Configuration

To use the Rapiscan Sensor Module, you have the option to configure three separate items in the OpenSensorHub node: a driver, TCP connection, and EML Ernie configuration.

- The driver connects to the rpm through a tcp connection and parses gamma and neutron data and publishes it to the OpenSensorHub framework.
- TCP connection allows the driver to connect to the RPM. You will need to provide and ip address, port and possibly a username and password.
- The EML service is for the VM250 RPM lanes only. Only configure this item if your lane is VM 250.


In the sensor system that you just created, we are going to add a rapiscan sensor that identifies as each of the lanes, and the other required sensors. 

## Configuring the Rapiscan Sensor Driver

First configure the Rapiscan Sensor. The default values are sufficient in some cases.

### General:** 
Settings common to all OpenSensorHub drivers on the "General" tab
- **Module ID:** *Not editable.* UUID automatically assigned by OpenSensorHub for this driver instance.
- **Module Class:** *Not editable.* The fully qualified name of the Java class implementing the driver.
- **Module Name:** A name for the instance of the driver. Should be set to something short and human-readable that describes the upstream source of data. This does not affect the operation of the driver, but is seen in user interfaces.
- **Description:** Any descriptive text that an administrator may want to enter for the benefit of users (or themselves).
- **SensorML URL:** URL to a SensorML description document for the driver or physical device the driver represents. Typically, this is left blank, and OpenSensorHub will populate the SensorML description with sensible defaults.
- **Serial Number:** A unique identifier 
- **Lane Name:** The name of the RPM lane.
- **Auto Start:** If checked, automatically start this sensor when the OSH node is launched or restarted.
- **Last Updated:** A timestamp that indicates when the settings were last changed. This can be edited if clients are watching the value for changes.
- - **Lane ID:** The lane number for the RPM system.

### Communication Provider: (*Settings to add communication protocol between the driver and the rpm*)
Protocol Options
- **Remote Host:**
- **Local Address:**
- **Username:**
- **Password:**
- **Remote Port:**
- **EnableTLS:**

### Connection Options:
- **Connection Timeout:** The client will wait this amount of time in ms for the remote side to respond.
- **Reconnect Period:** Time in ms that the client will wait to reconnect when the connection is lost 
- **Max Reconnect Attempts:** The number of attempts the client will take to reconnect when connection is lost or unavailable
- **Check Reachability:** Enable to check if remote is reachable before taking further action


### Position Config: 
Settings for the location and orientation of the rapiscan sensor. (Ignore if added in the Lane System)
Location:
- **Latitude:**
- **Longitude:**
- **Altitude:**


### EML Config: 
Settings for VM250 lanes, only configure these settings if the lane requires the EML service.
- **Lane Width:** Width of Lane in meters
- **Collimated:** Check if the lane is collimated.
- **Supplemental Algorithm:** If checked, this will initiate the eml service for the driver. 

### Setup Values from RPM Hardware
- **Intervals:**
- **Occupancy Holdin:**
- **NSigma**
